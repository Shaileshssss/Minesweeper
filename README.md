Minesweeper Game

Creating a Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves structuring the grid and cells with HTML, styling them for visual appeal and user interaction cues with CSS, and implementing the core game logic with JavaScript. JavaScript handles initializing the game, placing mines, calculating adjacent numbers, detecting cell clicks, revealing cells, flagging potential mines, and managing game states (win/lose conditions). Features like grid size selection, a flagging mechanism, and a timer enhance the user experience. This project is a comprehensive way to practice frontend development skills while building an interactive and engaging puzzle game.
